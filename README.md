First run:

sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install) --darwin-use-unencrypted-nix-store-volume

This will require sudo access

--darwin-use-unencrypted-nix-store-volume


why no --daemon?
  - It is rather...persnicity and tends to fail on a not 100% pristine install. may revisit as this is the recomended install
